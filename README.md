# Processing
The repository for my Processing programs.

## Screensaver
Makes a circle bounce around the screen. Both the circle and the background change color
### Process
Did pretty easily, then added features like color and flexibility.

## Serial
Takes input from a uart usb cable (see [this](https://github.com/sshanks49/circuitpy#toprocessing) for more information on that side) and displays that data on a dial.
### Process
This took a while, mostly because of a bad cable.
